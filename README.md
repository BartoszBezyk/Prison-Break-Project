# Prison-Break-Project
Python intro project

This is project called 'Prison Break'. It's one of the guided projects from dataquest.io platform. It covers the very basic analysys and exploration of data. The data comes from [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes) and stores informations about helicopter prison escapes.

The helper function that I used can be found [here](http://bioinf-mw.bihz.upwr.edu.pl/resources/dataquest/helper.py).
